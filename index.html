    <p><em>The AI Ethics Survival Manual for Teachers, with Only Mild Existential Dread</em></p>
</header>

    <h2>Welcome to The Educator’s Guide to the Galaxy</h2>
    <p>Teaching was already a rollercoaster. Then we added <strong>AI</strong>, and suddenly the loop-de-loops came with <strong>data privacy dilemmas</strong>, <strong>bias detection puzzles</strong>, and robots that promise to grade essays but can’t find their own commas.</p>
    <p>This is your <strong>friendly, slightly irreverent guide</strong> to <strong>understanding, teaching with, and surviving AI in education — ethically</strong>.</p>
    <p>Because if <strong>AI is going to join your classroom</strong>, it might as well <strong>play by the rules</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Why AI Ethics Matters</h2>
    <p>AI can <strong>personalize learning</strong>, <strong>automate grading</strong>, and <strong>free up your time</strong> — but it can also <strong>reinforce bias</strong>, <strong>invade privacy</strong>, and leave teachers holding the bag when things go wrong.</p>
    <p>Ethical AI isn’t just about compliance — it’s about <strong>trusting the tools you use</strong> and <strong>protecting your students</strong>.</p>
